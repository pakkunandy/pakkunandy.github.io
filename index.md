I'm **Anh Duy TRAN (MSE, CHFI)**. I am a Master (MSE) in **Communication System Security** at [**EURECOM**](https://www.eurecom.fr/en) and [**Télécom Paris**](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home) in France. My research focuses include many subjects in Computer and System Security, mostly in **Computer Forensics**, **Mobile System Security, Privacy** and **Software Security**. I work to help organizations to inspect digital evidence in the cyber-crime investigation process, to design secured systems and software. I am currently involved in memory forensics research with Prof. [Davide Balzarotti](http://s3.eurecom.fr/~balzarot/). Besides, I am a lecturer and a researcher in Computer Security in [VNU-HCMUS](https://en.hcmus.edu.vn/). In my free time, I play CTF with [NOPS](http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/nops/index.html) team, EURECOM.
