<!-- I'm **Anh Duy TRAN (MSE, CHFI)**. I am a Master (MSE) in **Communication System Security** at [**EURECOM**](https://www.eurecom.fr/en) and [**Télécom Paris**](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home) in France. My research focuses include many subjects in Computer and System Security, mostly in **Computer Forensics**, **Mobile System Security, Privacy** and **Software Security**. I work to help organizations to inspect digital evidence in the cyber-crime investigation process, to design secured systems and software.  -->

I am a Ph.D. student in the research group [**DistriNet**](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/) at the Computer Science department of the **Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KU Leuven)**, under the supervision of [**Prof. Wouter Joosen**](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/people/WouterJoosen).
My research focuses include various subjects in Computer and System Security, mostly in Software Security, Computer and Multimedia Forensics, Malware Analysis, Mobile Security, Privacy.
I obtained a Diplôme d'ingénieur (Master of Science in Engineering) **Communication System Security** at [**EURECOM**](https://www.eurecom.fr/en) and [**Télécom Paris**](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home) in France. My Master's thesis is about the Memory Forensics, under the supervision of [**Prof. Davide Balzarotti**](http://s3.eurecom.fr/~balzarot/).
I am the founder of [**Computer Security Club**](https://www.facebook.com/hcmus.compsec.club) at University of Science, VNU-HCM. I sometime play CTF with codename **pakkunandy** and I also host HCMUS-CTF every year.
