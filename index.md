I'm **Anh Duy TRAN**. I am a Master (MSE) in Communication System Security at [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr/en) and [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home) in France. My research focuses include many subjects in Computer and System Security, mostly in Computer Forensics, Mobile System Security, Privacy and Software Security. I work to help organizations to inspect digital evidence in the cyber-crime investigation process, to design a secured system and software. I am currently involved in memory forensics project with Prof. [Davide Balzarotti](http://s3.eurecom.fr/~balzarot/). Besides, I am a lecturer and a researcher in Computer Security in [VNU-HCMUS](https://en.hcmus.edu.vn/). In my free time, I play CTF with [NOPS](http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/nops/index.html) team, EURECOM.
